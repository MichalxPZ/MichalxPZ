## Hi there 👋

👋 I'm Michał Zieliński, a software developer with a focus on backend and fullstack engineering, currently finishing my degree at Poznań University of Technology. During my studies, I’ve explored distributed systems and data processing technologies to better understand how to build scalable, cloud-native solutions.

💻 I have hands-on experience designing and implementing document-centric systems and workflow automation platforms using technologies such as Alfresco, Spring Boot, Docker, and Camunda. I'm comfortable working across the stack - from designing APIs to optimizing infrastructure.

☁️ Commercial experience with Google Cloud Platform and a certification in Microsoft Azure help me understand the cloud from multiple angles — from deployment pipelines to service orchestration.

⚙️ I enjoy working with Kotlin, Java, Spring, Android, and containerized environments. I'm driven by clean architecture, automation, and constant improvement.

🚀 Outside of coding, I follow Formula 1, play and watch football, bake Neapolitan pizza at home, and dance Cuban salsa - because life’s better with passion and rhythm.

Let’s connect!
